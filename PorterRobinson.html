<span>Who is He?</span>    
</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 180px; margin-right: 180px;"> Porter Robinson is an electronic music artist from the U.S. who started out making high-energy EDM tracks like "Language" and "Spitfire." Over time, his style changed a lot. His 2014 album Worlds introduced a more emotional, dreamy sound that really connected with fans and was a groundbreaking album in the world of EDM music. The 2016 song "Shelter", which is a collab with Madeon was a hit among the EDM community, getting it's own anime music video.  After a long hiatus from making music after Shelter, he dropped Nurture in 2021. This album is super personal and features him singing on most of the tracks, as well as a voice changer. He also has a side project called Virtual Self that’s inspired by early 2000s rave and video game music. In 2024, he returned to the music scene with his third album, SMILE :D. This album took a lot of inspiration from pop-punk and hyperpop. A lot of people love his music because it feels nostalgic, emotional, and really different from typical EDM.

<h2>Shelter</h2>

This single features Madeon's vocals and is widely regarded as one of Porter Robinson's and Madeon's most popular songs. There is a music video that accompanies the song that was created in partership with A-1 Pictures and Crunchyroll, a popular anime streaming service. The music video follows Rin, a girl living alone in a virtual world she controls with a tablet. As memories return, she learns her father saved her from Earth’s destruction by sending her into space in a simulation pod. The story is about love, sacrifice, and loneliness.
